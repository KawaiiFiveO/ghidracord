# Installation
Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/imxeno/ghidracord/releases/latest) page, then install and enable it like any other Ghidra extension (`File` -> `Install Extensions...`). You may need to *Configure* the extension (whatever that means) for every *Tool* that you open. Just click the checkbox and you're good to go.
